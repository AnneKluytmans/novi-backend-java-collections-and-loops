# Backend Java – Lesson 3 Practice: Methods, Collections, Control Flow & Loops

## About the Project

This repository contains my solutions to the **Lesson 3 practice assignments** from the Backend Java module at [Novi University](https://www.novi.nl).

The exercises are designed to strengthen understanding of fundamental Java concepts such as **methods**, **decision structures (if/else, switch)**, **loops (for, while)**, and **collections (arrays and ArrayLists)**. Each assignment focuses on writing clean, reusable code and applying logic to solve simple but realistic programming tasks.
